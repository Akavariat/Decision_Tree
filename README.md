# Decision_Tree
This is a simple Machine Learning project. The goal was to apply a decision tree to a Kaggle dataset and see what'd happen.

The dataset contains data about potential pulsars (highly magnetized rotating neutron stars). The decision tree is then applied and predicts if a particular star is a pulsar or not.

The dataset is included in this project, but is otherwise available here: https://www.kaggle.com/pavanraj159/predicting-a-pulsar-star/

You will need the following in order for this to work:

  - Graphviz: https://www.graphviz.org/
  - Anaconda (optional): https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
  - pydotplus
  
Although Anaconda is optional, I highly recommend it as it contains a useful suite of libraries for Machine Learning and Data Science. Additionally, it's a lot better than installing all of the libraries by hand.
